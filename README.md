# Concert Management System
This project is a web-based Concert Management System, inspired by platforms like Ticketmaster, allowing users to dynamically manage concerts and artists. Users can create, edit, delete, and view concert details such as dates, times, venues, and associated artists. The system leverages Django for backend development and its ORM to interact with a relational database.
